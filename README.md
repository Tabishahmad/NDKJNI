**Android App with C++ Integration**


**Project Overview:**

This open-source Android application demonstrates how to integrate C++ code into an Android project using the Android NDK (Native Development Kit). The app showcases the power of combining native C++ performance with the flexibility of Java/Kotlin for Android development.

**Key Features:**

- C++ Integration: The app demonstrates how to incorporate C++ code seamlessly with Java/Kotlin to perform performance-intensive tasks.
- JNI (Java Native Interface): Utilizes JNI to create a bridge between the Java/Kotlin and C++ code, allowing seamless communication between the two languages.
- Reverse String Functionality: A simple yet illustrative feature showcases how a C++ function can be called from Java/Kotlin to reverse a given string.
- Custom UI: The app features a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, designed to provide a smooth user experience.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Tabishahmad/NDKJNI.git
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Install NDK and configure CMake for your project (if not already done).
4. Build the project and run it on an Android device or emulator.
5. Explore the app to see the reverse string functionality and the seamless C++ integration.

**Disclaimer:**

Please note that this project is intended for educational and illustrative purposes. It is not a full-fledged application and may not cover all edge cases.
